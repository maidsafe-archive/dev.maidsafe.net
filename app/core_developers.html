          The SAFE Network is comprised of several individual libraries. The
          following section, aimed at the more technical reader, provides a
          more detailed explanation of what role each library performs and how
          they fit together.
          <br>
          The following diagram provides an overview of the SAFE Network stack

        <p class="p">
          The code for each library is available in  <a href="https://github.com/maidsafe">MaidSafe's GitHub repositories.</a>

          <h3 class="sub-title">The core libraries are:</h3>
          <ul class="list">
            <li>
              Crust - Reliable P2P network connections in Rust with NAT
              traversal. One of the most needed libraries for any server-less,
              decentralized project.
            </li>
            <li>
              Routing - A secured DHT, based on a Kademlia-like implementation,
              that has group-based consensus decisions confirmed by Sentinel.
            </li>
            <li>
              Vault - An autonomous network that performs many functions
              including: data storage, data management, publishing and sharing.
              Vaults receive responsibilities for anything with a network
              address from the routing layer.
            </li>
            <li>
              Encrypt - Self-encrypting files (convergent encryption plus
              obfuscation) which can be accessed via either a REST or POSIX API.
               The REST API offers simplicity (GET, PUT, POST, DELETE),
               while the POSIX API provides more granular access.
            </li>
            <li>
              Client - The main entry point to the network, providing REST API
              access, POSIX API access
            </li>
          </ul>
