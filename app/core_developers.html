  The SAFE Network is comprised of several individual libraries. The
  following section, aimed at the more technical reader, provides a
  more detailed explanation of what role each library performs and how
  they fit together.

  The following diagram provides an overview of the SAFE Network stack

  <h3 class="sub-title">The core libraries are:</h3>
  <ul class="list">
    <li>
      Crust - Reliable P2P network connections in Rust with NAT
      traversal. One of the most needed libraries for any server-less,
      decentralized project.
    </li>
    <li>
      Routing - A secured DHT, based on a Kademlia-like implementation,
      that has group-based consensus decisions confirmed by Sentinel.
    </li>
    <li>
      Vault - An autonomous network that performs many functions
      including: data storage, data management, publishing and sharing.
      Vaults receive responsibilities for anything with a network
      address from the routing layer.
    </li>
    <li>
      Encrypt - Self-encrypting files (convergent encryption plus
      obfuscation) which can be accessed via either a REST or POSIX API.
       The REST API offers simplicity (GET, PUT, POST, DELETE),
       while the POSIX API provides more granular access.
    </li>
    <li>
      Client - The main entry point to the network, providing REST API
      access, POSIX API access
    </li>
  </ul>
