          Reliable P2P network connections in Rust with NAT traversal. This
          library will enable P2P networks to establish and maintain a number
          of connections in a group when informed by users of the library. As
          connections are made, they are passed up and the user can select which
           connections to maintain or drop. TCP connections are always
           favoured, as these will be directly connected (until TCP hole
           punching is implemented) by default and TCP is also a known and
           reliable protocol. Reliable UDP operates as a fall back protocol
           and is very effective.
        </p>
        <p class="p">
          Crust contains a bootstrap handler which will attempt to reconnect
          to any previous "direct connected" nodes, while the libraries
          beaconing system enables nodes on a local network to be found.
          This functionality will be extended in due course using a gossip
          type protocol for multi hop discovery.
        </p>
        <p class="p">
          The user of the library has the option to provide a blacklisting
          capability per session to disconnect such nodes 'en masse'.
          <br>
          _direct connected == Nodes we were previously connected to.
          TCP nodes or reliable UDP nodes that allow incoming connections
          (i.e. direct or full cone NAT that has been hole punched). This
          library also supports fall-back endpoints being passed at
          construction that will allow a fall-back should nodes from previous
          sessions become unavailable.
        </p>

          <h3 class="sub-title">Nat traversal/Handling</h3>
          <p class="p">
            Several methods are used for NAT traversal, UpNP, hole punching 
            <a href="http://www.cmlab.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~franklai/NATBT.pdf">
            See here for TCP NAT traversal</a> and 
            <a href="http://maidsafe.net/Whitepapers/pdf/DHTbasedNATTraversal.pdf">
              here for UCP/DHT NAT traversal
            </a> etc. These methods will be added to by the community to allow
            a p2p network that cannot be easily blocked. By default this library
            spawns sockets randomly, enabling nodes to appear on several ports
            over time. This makes them very difficult to trace.
