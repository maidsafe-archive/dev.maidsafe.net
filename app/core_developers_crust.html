<h3 class="title">Crust</h3>
<p class="p">
  Reliable P2P network connections in Rust with NAT traversal. This
  library will enable P2P networks to establish and maintain a number
  of connections in a group when informed by users of the library. As
  connections are made, they are passed up and the user can select which
   connections to maintain or drop. TCP connections are always
   favoured, as these will be directly connected (until TCP hole
   punching is implemented) by default and TCP is also a known and
   reliable protocol. Reliable UDP operates as a fall back protocol
   and is very effective.
</p>
<p class="p">
  Crust contains a bootstrap handler which will attempt to reconnect
  to any previous "direct connected" nodes, while the libraries
  beaconing system enables nodes on a local network to be found.
  This functionality will be extended in due course using a gossip
  type protocol for multi hop discovery.
</p>
<p class="p">
  The user of the library has the option to provide a blacklisting
  capability per session to disconnect such nodes 'en masse'.
  <br>
  _direct connected == Nodes we were previously connected to.
  TCP nodes or reliable UDP nodes that allow incoming connections
  (i.e. direct or full cone NAT that has been hole punched). This
  library also supports fall-back endpoints being passed at
  construction that will allow a fall-back should nodes from previous
  sessions become unavailable.

  <h3 class="sub-title">Nat traversal/Handling</h3>
  <p class="p">
    Several methods are used for NAT traversal, UpNP, hole punching 
    <a href="http://www.cmlab.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~franklai/NATBT.pdf">
    See here for TCP NAT traversal</a> and 
    <a href="http://maidsafe.net/Whitepapers/pdf/DHTbasedNATTraversal.pdf">
      here for UCP/DHT NAT traversal
    </a> etc. These methods will be added to by the community to allow
    a p2p network that cannot be easily blocked. By default this library
    spawns sockets randomly, enabling nodes to appear on several ports
    over time. This makes them very difficult to trace.
