          <h3 class="sub-title">Prepare for your MaidSafe interview:</h3>
          <ul class="list">
            <li>Know what interests you about maidsafe and why you've applied.</li>
            <li>Familiarise yourself with our products(you may be asked business-related questions). Research our competitors.</li>
            <li>
              If you are interviewing for software engineering or technical role, be ready to answer high-level technical questions
              on data-structures and algorithms. We would like you to codte up your answers on boards with our people.
            </li>
            <li>Familiarise yourself with the job description you are interested in.</li>
            <li>
              If you are interviewing for software engineering role and are experienced in c++ or java then you may first
              want to visit this website. You may find the questions these very similar to what you may be asked to describe [spoilers]
            </li>
            <li>
              If you are interviewing for software engineering role become familiar with, c++ or python, kademila DHT and networking
              technologies such as NAT travesal, ice, upnp, stun, turn, udp and tcp communication. Failure to do this will waste everyone's
              time and could be embarrassing (although we try hard not to).
            </li>
            <li>
              Ensure you can substantiate anything your CV says - for instance, if you list java, c++ or ice skating,
              questions about this are fair game and are very likely to be asked of you.
            </li>

          <h3 class="sub-title">At the interview</h3>
          <p class="p">
            First of all congratulations, you have something in your CV that we find interesting and special.
          </p>
          <ul class="list">
            <li>
              We do not wear suits to work and neither should you to an interview, smart but casual is more comfortable.
            </li>
            <li>Probably you will be there 1 hour or 2 hours with a break.</li>
            <li>
              You will be asked to draw on a whiteboard the answers to many technical questions - we want to hear how
              you think.
            </li>
            <li>We will most likely make you tea coffee etc. or possibly have a game of darts during the interview.</li>
            <li>There are a few of us in the office at any time - it's how we work, do not be concerned about the people moving around you.</li>
