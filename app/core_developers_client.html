<h3 class="title">Client</h3>
<p class="p">
  The main entry point to the network, providing REST API access and POSIX API access, in addition to the following:
</p>
<ul class="list">
  <li>
    Self-authentication - A mechanism that enables users to create
    accounts on the SAFE Network and log in from any computer without
    the need or knowledge of third parties
  </li>
  <li>
    Messaging - This module handles communication between public
    identities in the network. All communication between MPID's
    (MaidSafe Public ID's) in the network are private and digitally
    signed
  </li>
</ul>
<p class="p">
  The following features are on the development roadmap and will be
  added in due course:
</p>
<ul class="list">
  <li>
    Safecoin - A cryptographic network token that is integral to the
    network, rewarding and incentivizing all network contributors. API
    access will enable balance check, transfer, escrow and multi-sig
    functionality
  </li>
  <li>
    Compute - Still to be implemented, this module will enable the
    processing of distributed computing actions, leveraging the massive
    processing capability of the decentralized system
  </li>
</ul>
