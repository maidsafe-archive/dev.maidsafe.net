          The main entry point to the network, providing REST API access and POSIX API access, in addition to the following:
        </p>
        <ul class="list">
          <li>
            Self-authentication - A mechanism that enables users to create
            accounts on the SAFE Network and log in from any computer without
            the need or knowledge of third parties
          </li>
          <li>
            Messaging - This module handles communication between public
            identities in the network. All communication between MPID's
            (MaidSafe Public ID's) in the network are private and digitally
            signed
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p class="p">
          The following features are on the development roadmap and will be
          added in due course:
        </p>
        <ul class="list">
          <li>
            Safecoin - A cryptographic network token that is integral to the
            network, rewarding and incentivizing all network contributors. API
            access will enable balance check, transfer, escrow and multi-sig
            functionality
          </li>
          <li>
            Compute - Still to be implemented, this module will enable the
            processing of distributed computing actions, leveraging the massive
            processing capability of the decentralized system
