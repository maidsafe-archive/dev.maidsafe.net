<h3 class="title">Routing</h3>
<p class="p">
  A specialised storage DHT. A secured 
  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_hash_table"
  target="_blank">DHT</a>, based on a 
  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kademlia" target="_blank">kademlia-like</a>
  implementation, but with some very stark
  differences. This is a recursive, as opposed to iterative network,
  enabling easier NAT traversal, providing more efficient use of
  routers and larger networks. This also allows very fast
  reconfiguration of network changes, alleviating the requirement for
  a refresh algorithm. A recursive solution based on a network
  protocol layer that is 'connection oriented' also allows a close
  group to be aligned with security protocols.

  This library makes use of 
  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public-key_cryptography"
  target="_blank">Public-key cryptography</a> 
  to allow a mechanism to ensure nodes are well recognised and
  cryptographically secured. This pattern allows the creation of a DHT
  based PKI and this in turn allows a decentralised network to make
  use of groups as fixed in relation to any address. This is
  particularly useful in a continually fluid network as described 
  <a href="http://maidsafe.net/Whitepapers/pdf/MaidSafeDistributedHashTable.pdf"
  target="_blank">here</a>, creating a server-less and
  <a href="http://maidsafe.net/docs/SAFEnetwork.pdf" target="_blank">autonomous network.</a>

  This is a very under researched area. For a general introduction to
  some of the ideas behind the design related to XOR Space, watching 
  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9FJRDcNzk&list=PLiYqQVdgdw_sSDkdIZzDRQR9xZlsukIxD">
    The SAFE Network from First Principles series</a> 
  is recommended. The slides for XOR Distance Metric and Basic Routing
  lecture are also <a href="http://ericklavoie.com/talks/safenetwork/1-xor-routing.pdf">
    available here</a>. The last video from the series on
  how the same ideas were applied to decentralised BitTorrent trackers
  is available <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFV908uoLPY">
  here</a>. A proper formalisation of the Routing algorithm
  is in progress.

  <h3 class="sub-title">Pre-requisite:</h3>
  <p class="p">
    libsodium is a native dependency for 
    <a href="https://github.com/dnaq/sodiumoxide">sodiumxoide</a>.
    Thus, install sodium by following the instructions
    <a href="http://doc.libsodium.org/installation/index.html">here</a>.
    &nbsp;For windows, download and use the 
    <a href="https://download.libsodium.org/libsodium/releases/libsodium-1.0.2-mingw.tar.gz">prebuilt mingw library</a>.
    Extract and place the libsodium.a file in "bin\x86_64-pc-windows-gnu"
    &nbsp;for 64bit System, or "bin\i686-pc-windows-gnu" for a 32bit system.
