        <p class="p">
          An autonomous network capable of: data storage, publishing and
          sharing, as well as: computation, value transfer (crypto currency
          support) and more…
        </p>
        <p class="p">
          The SAFE Network consists of software processes (nodes), referred to
          as vaults. These vaults perform many functions on the network and
          these functional components are referred to as personas. The
          underlying network, when linked with 
          <a href="https://github.com/maidsafe/routing">routing</a>,
          is an XOR network and therefore a node may express closeness
          (responsibility) to any other node, or element on the network, if the
          node is in relative close proximity to the target. In this summary,
          the phrase NAE (Network Addressable Element) is used to refer to
          anything with a network address including data.
        </p>
        <p class="p">
          The vaults rely on 
          <a href="https://github.com/maidsafe/routing">routing</a>
          &nbsp;to calculate responsibilities for NAE via
          the relevant 
          <a href="http://maidsafe.net/routing/master/routing/index.html/">
          API calls</a>. These calls enable the network to calculate
          from the perspective of any NAE they are responsible for. It cannot
          be stressed enough that the ONLY way to determine responsibility for
          an NAE is to see the network from the perspective on the NAE. If the
          vector of nodes is sorted, their close nodes (referred to as the
          group matrix) can be understood. If the node in question does not
          appear in the first K (replication count) nodes then it is not
          responsible for the NAE.
        </p>
        <p class="p">
          As the network is very fluid in terms of churn and vault
          capabilities, the vault network must measure and report on individual
          vaults and importantly ensure all the personas of any vault are
          performing their tasks for the NAE they are responsible for. In the
          event of churn around a given network segment, a Matrix change object
          is created by Routing and passed on to Vault. This object contains
          list of old and new nodes in  the group matrix. The vaults use this
          information as a helper function to derive certain information
          related to any given NAE.
        </p>
        <p class="p">
          Churn, duplication of data and ensuring all members of a group agree
          is handled by a combination of synchronisation, The Accumulator and
          group messages. This is a complex set of rules that requires
          significant attention to edge cases.
        </p>
