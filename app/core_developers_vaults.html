<h3 class="title">Vaults</h3>
<p class="p">
  An autonomous network capable of: data storage, publishing and
  sharing, as well as: computation, value transfer (crypto currency
  support) and more…
</p>
<p class="p">
  The SAFE Network consists of software processes (nodes), referred to
  as vaults. These vaults perform many functions on the network and
  these functional components are referred to as personas. The
  underlying network, when linked with 
  <a href="https://github.com/maidsafe/routing">routing</a>,
  is an XOR network and therefore a node may express closeness
  (responsibility) to any other node, or element on the network, if the
  node is in relative close proximity to the target. In this summary,
  the phrase NAE (Network Addressable Element) is used to refer to
  anything with a network address including data.
</p>
<p class="p">
  The vaults rely on 
  <a href="https://github.com/maidsafe/routing">routing</a>
  &nbsp;to calculate responsibilities for NAE via
  the relevant 
  <a href="http://maidsafe.net/routing/master/routing/index.html/">
  API calls</a>. These calls enable the network to calculate
  from the perspective of any NAE they are responsible for. It cannot
  be stressed enough that the ONLY way to determine responsibility for
  an NAE is to see the network from the perspective on the NAE. If the
  vector of nodes is sorted, their close nodes (referred to as the
  group matrix) can be understood. If the node in question does not
  appear in the first K (replication count) nodes then it is not
  responsible for the NAE.
</p>
<p class="p">
  As the network is very fluid in terms of churn and vault
  capabilities, the vault network must measure and report on individual
  vaults and importantly ensure all the personas of any vault are
  performing their tasks for the NAE they are responsible for. In the
  event of churn around a given network segment, a Matrix change object
  is created by Routing and passed on to Vault. This object contains
  list of old and new nodes in  the group matrix. The vaults use this
  information as a helper function to derive certain information
  related to any given NAE.
</p>
<p class="p">
  Churn, duplication of data and ensuring all members of a group agree
  is handled by a combination of synchronisation, The Accumulator and
  group messages. This is a complex set of rules that requires
  significant attention to edge cases.
