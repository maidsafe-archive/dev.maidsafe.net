<h3 class="title">Self-Encryption</h3>
<p class="p">
  Self-encrypting files (convergent encryption plus obfuscation) which
  can be accessed via either a REST or POSIX API. The REST API offers
  simplicity (GET, PUT, POST, DELETE), while the POSIX API provides
  more granular access.
</p>
<p class="p">
  A version of 
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convergent_encryption">
  convergent encryption</a> with an additional obfuscation step. This
  pattern enables secured data that can also be 
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_deduplication">
  de-duplicated</a>. This library presents an API that can be
  utilised in any application that provides a POSIX like filesystem
  interface, dealing very effectively with the content part of any data
  (in tests the parallelised approach can actually be faster than
  reading/writing data as a single stream). It is important to realise
  two important aspects of this library:
</p>
<ul class="list">
  <li>This library deals with file content <b>only</b></li>
  <li>This library provides very secure data, but does return a data
    structure (DataMap) that in turn requires to be secured.
  </li>
</ul>
